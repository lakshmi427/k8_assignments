1. Replica Set:

Replica set is used to ensure that a specific set of Pods is running at all times. It is kind of like a watch dog.
Daemon set is a way to ensure that a Pod is present on a defined set of Nodes of a cluster. If a node gets added/deleted, Daemon set automatically add/delete the pod.
Common use case where we use Deamon is Monitoring Exporters.

2. Deployment:

kubectl patch deployment kubia -p '{"spec": {"minReadySeconds": 10}}'
kubectl set image deployment kubia nodejs=luksa/kubia:v2

3. Service:

4. VOTING APP -DEMO practical:

After casting the vote:- Able to see the change in pod/result which is changing the RESTARTS number as well.
After deleting voter pod - no difference. Noticed that new vote pod is getting created immediately with different ID. 
After deleting worker pod:- no difference. Noticed that new worker pod is getting created immediately with different ID. 
After deleting db pod:- Able to see the updated result in RESTARTS but not in the results app.results didn't get update. 
                        Noticed that new worker db pod is getting created immediately with different ID. 

To fix, deleted the result pod:-  kubectl delete po result-5d57b59f4b-j68kj

Then a new copy of the result-app pod will be created and that will connect to the db.
